The goal of this project was to apply our data science skills to a real world dataset, dealing with the challenges of working with uncleaned data,
and API engines. It was completed in my Techniques of Data Science class (Data 100).
I used iPython (Jupyter Notebook environment), a Twitter Developer Account, and Twitter's Standard API to clean and analyze tweet data, and 
make inferences about the President Trump's Tweet behavior. I also defined a few statistics to aid in my analysis.
